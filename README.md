# Better Zwift Events

This projects provides a progressive Web application which goal is to provide a better experience for [Zwift events](https://zwift.com/events/).
Sadly, Zwift does not provide any open API but only a single endpoint to fetch next events. So, this application only uses this endpoint and even if the user experience is better (personal feeling) than the official Zwift events page, it will be nice to have more endpoints and data to play with and so to provide better features.

This project uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) and the wondeful [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build and host the application on https://better-zwift-events.netlify.app/.
